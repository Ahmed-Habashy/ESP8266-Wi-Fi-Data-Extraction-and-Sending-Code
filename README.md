# ESP8266-Wi-Fi-Data-Extraction-and-Sending-Code
This code is designed to run on an ESP8266 microcontroller and to send data via Wi-Fi using the ESP8266WiFi and WiFiUDP libraries.

# Hardware Requirements
To run this code, you will need:

An ESP8266 microcontroller
A Wi-Fi network to connect to
Software Requirements
You will need the following software to run this code:

The Arduino IDE (or similar software) to upload the code to the ESP8266
The ESP8266WiFi and WiFiUDP libraries
Getting Started
Before uploading the code to the ESP8266, you will need to make sure that the following variables are set correctly:

ssid: the name of the Wi-Fi network to connect to
password: the password for the Wi-Fi network
localUdpPort: the local port to listen on for incoming packets
ip, gateway, subnet, and DNS: the IP address, gateway, subnet mask, and DNS server for the ESP8266
Once these variables are set correctly, you can upload the code to the ESP8266.

# How it Works
This code listens for incoming UDP packets on the specified localUdpPort. When a packet is received, the code reads the contents of the packet and prints it to the serial monitor. If the packet begins with the characters "123*@", the code prints a line of asterisks to the serial monitor (for use with an Arduino Mega). If the packet begins with the characters "xxxxx", the code prints a line of x's to the serial monitor.

In addition to listening for incoming UDP packets, the code also listens for data sent over the serial connection. When data is received over the serial connection, the code sends it as a UDP packet to the IP address that sent the most recent UDP packet to the ESP8266.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble getting this code to work, make sure that the following are true:

The ssid and password variables are set correctly
The ESP8266 is connected to a Wi-Fi network
The localUdpPort, ip, gateway, subnet, and DNS variables are set correctly
The serial monitor is set to the correct baud rate (19200)
